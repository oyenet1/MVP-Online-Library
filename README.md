# E-Library

### The e-library software is a platform where the digital and physical worlds of reading come together. With our platform, users can browse our extensive catalog of books online and select their desired titles for borrowing. But here's a twist: Instead of digital copies, users have the opportunity to physically pick up their chosen books from our library. This unique approach combines the convinence of online access with the joy of holding a physical book, creating a truly immersive reading experience. Wheather you prefer the ease of digital reading or the tactile pleasure of a physical book, our e-library offers the best of both worlds. Once a book is selected, users have a grnerous borrowing period of 10 days. During this time, they can fully enjoy the book, delve into it's pages and explore it's world. If a book is not returned within the 10-day period, we will send a friendly email reminder, ensuring that everyone has a fair chance at enjoying our collection.
